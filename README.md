# My Portfolio

## Overview

This is a portfolio website for me (Brian Slaby), to showcase my frontend developer skills.  I built it using React and TypeScript, with navigation using React Router 6.  The Home page includes About Me, Projects, and Contact Me sections.  Each project has its own details page, which includes an overview, a project features list, a list of technology used to build the project, a gallery of screenshot images, and links to the live site and GitHub repositories.
